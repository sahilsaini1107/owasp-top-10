# owasp-top-10

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Here's an overview to help you study the OWASP Top 10:

### OWASP Top 10 Overview

1. **Broken Access Control**
   - Description: Exploitation of flaws that allow unauthorized users to access restricted functions or data.
   - Examples: Bypassing authentication, accessing sensitive data, or performing actions as another user.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Implement Proper Authorization Checks:** Ensure that authorization checks are performed at every layer of your application.
    - **Least Privilege Principle:** Users should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles and assign permissions accordingly.
    - **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Use ACLs to specify what resources users can access.
    - **Automated Tools:** Use automated tools to test for access control issues.

2. **Cryptographic Failures**
   - Description: Issues related to the protection of data in transit and at rest.
   - Examples: Inadequate encryption, use of weak cryptographic algorithms, or poor key management.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Use Strong Encryption Standards:** Use up-to-date, strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries (e.g., AES, RSA).
    - **Secure Key Management:** Ensure keys are stored securely and rotated regularly.
    - **TLS Everywhere:** Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all data in transit.
    - **Avoid Deprecated Algorithms:** Avoid using deprecated algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1.
    - **Proper Randomization:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators.

3. **Injection**
   - Description: Insertion of malicious code into a program through an untrusted input.
   - Examples: SQL injection, Command injection, or LDAP injection.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Always use parameterized queries for database access.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
    - **ORMs:** Use Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to abstract database interactions.
    - **Escaping:** Properly escape inputs if parameterized queries are not possible.
    - **Least Privilege Principle:** Run databases and other services with minimal privileges.

4. **Insecure Design**
   - Description: Inherent flaws in design that compromise security.
   - Examples: Lack of secure design principles, threat modeling, or security requirements.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Secure Design Principles:** Follow secure design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege, and fail-safe defaults.
    - **Threat Modeling:** Regularly perform threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential security threats.
    - **Security Requirements:** Incorporate security requirements into the development lifecycle.
    - **Design Reviews:** Conduct regular design reviews with a focus on security.

5. **Security Misconfiguration**
   - Description: Improperly configured or insecure default configurations.
   - Examples: Unnecessary services enabled, default accounts, or outdated software.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Automated Configuration Management:** Use tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to manage configurations.
    - **Secure Defaults:** Ensure default configurations are secure.
    - **Regular Updates:** Keep software and dependencies up-to-date.
    - **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Turn off any features, services, or accounts that are not needed.
    - **Environment Segregation:** Use separate environments for development, testing, and production.

6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
   - Description: Use of libraries, frameworks, and other software modules with known vulnerabilities.
   - Examples: Using old versions of software with known security issues.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Use tools like Dependabot to keep libraries and frameworks up-to-date.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check.
    - **Monitor Vulnerability Databases:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases like CVE.
    - **Component Inventory:** Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all components and their versions.

7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**
   - Description: Issues related to the authentication and session management.
   - Examples: Weak passwords, unprotected session IDs, or flawed multi-factor authentication.
 **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to enhance security.
    - **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies and educate users on creating strong passwords.
    - **Secure Session Management:** Use secure session tokens and manage session lifetimes appropriately.
    - **Account Lockout Mechanisms:** Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
    - **OAuth and OpenID Connect:** Use industry-standard protocols for authentication and authorization.

8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
   - Description: Code and infrastructure that do not protect against integrity violations.
   - Examples: Dependency on insecure software, untrusted sources, or insufficient code signing.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures to verify the integrity of software and data.
    - **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Integrate security practices into your SDLC.
    - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Security:** Secure your CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized changes.
    - **Supply Chain Security:** Vet third-party components and maintain an inventory of trusted sources.


9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
   - Description: Lack of logging and monitoring, leading to delayed or missed detection of security breaches.
   - Examples: Insufficient logging, missing monitoring of critical functions, or poor alerting.
  **Prevention Methods:**
    - **Comprehensive Logging:** Log all security-relevant events, including failed login attempts, access to sensitive data, and administrative actions.
    - **Centralized Logging:** Use centralized logging systems like ELK Stack or Splunk for easier monitoring.
    - **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit logs for suspicious activities.
    - **Alerting Mechanisms:** Implement real-time alerting for critical security events.
    - **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan to handle detected security events.

10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    - Description: Exploitation of server-side functionality to make unauthorized requests.
    - Examples: Sending requests to internal systems from an application.
  **Prevention Methods:**
      - **Whitelist/Blacklist:** Use whitelisting to limit the destinations of outgoing requests.
      - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate internal services to minimize the impact of SSRF attacks.
      - **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs that generate server-side requests.
      - **Metadata API Access Control:** Restrict access to metadata APIs and internal endpoints.
      - **HTTP Request Methods:** Limit the HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, POST) allowed for server-side requests.
